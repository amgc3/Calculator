# Calculator
This is a repository to house a small JavaScript exercise.
The calculator can perform operations on any number of operands. It can also calculate the number of vowels in a string and output how many times 
There are three solutions, each with a different take.
each vowel occurs in the string
cli-index.js uses cli-select, a simple and interactive solution to provide a list of selectable items on the command line; chalk to provide colour support; figures for symbols (here the circles for radio buttons) - all on the command line
