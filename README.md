# Calculator
This is a repository to house a small JavaScript exercise.
The calculator can perform each operation on any number of operands. It can also calculate the number of vowels in a string and output how many times 
There are three solutions, each with a different take.

calculator-cli.js uses cli-select. This is a simple and interactive solution that provides a list of selectable items on the command line; chalk provides colour support; figures was used for symbols (here the circles for radio buttons).
